look at how/where to capture user session so can add geo location against correct user
make a 'show locations for user' page.

Sunday 24th November

Got some nice front end working
Fixed the BCrypt issue - had to upgrade the Gem
Fixed incorrect gmail mailer settings - got sign-up working
Clicking link in activation email doesnt work, because DNS cannot find the local lunch.saigoslocal domain of course, but set the activation field in the User record to true to allow log in for now.

Next - 
more front end stuff, need to make the User page look ok ( page after logging in )
Need to make the error messages look good, for example if try and sign up with an email address already used. 
Also the message after activate the account.
