SSL is required for production - see 7.51. SSL in production in Hartl book

Finish the user log in stuff

Make a restaurants controller and model, with create, and show etc...
Maybe this just lists the restaurants, but can drill down to see the underlying address info. 
( use the Hartl microposts and user follower code help improve this above ideas )

Later - use geo code, maybe the drill down opens google maps ?
