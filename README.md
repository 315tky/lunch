# lunch

Ideas and ToDos :
- Restaurants model
- Users model ( will need account / login feature etc.. )
- Geolocation/geocoder features
- Tags / Tagging model/s - allow tags for places ( this perhaps negates needing a place 'type' etc.. )
- Search
- Favourite place feature - User can mark favs in their list, others can view etc.. 
- Users 'follow' or 'connect' feature, allows such features as notifcation of when a user adds a new place
    - maybe a broadcast feature, to alert friends you are at a certain place, for meet-up etc..
