# lunch

Ideas and ToDos :
- Restuarants model
- Users model
- Geolocation/geocoder features
- Tags / Tagging model/s ( User tags restaurant in his list, tags belong to user, refer to restaurant ) - if have tags, maybe no need for having a 'restuarant types' or descriptions - let user tag instead ??
- Favourites feature ( User marks restaurant in users restuarant list as Fav, appears in users Fav restaurant list )
