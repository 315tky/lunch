# lunch

Ideas and ToDos :
- Restaurants model
- Users model
- Geolocation/geocoder features
- Tags / Tagging model/s ( User tags restaurant in his list, tags belong to user, refer to restaurant ) - if have tags, maybe no need for having a 'restaurant types' or descriptions - let user tag instead ??
- Favourites feature ( User marks restaurant in users restuarant list as Fav, appears in users Fav restaurant list )
- Users 'follow' users feature, can then include, e.g., notifcation of when a user adds a new place
    - With some user control features on what followers can see/access, could maybe have some kind of a <i>'meet me'</i> feature, and/or a kind of broadcast feature, <i>'I'm here now, meet me for lunch if you are nearby'</i>
